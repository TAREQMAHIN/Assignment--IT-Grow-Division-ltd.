For this project I have used a simple SQL database to store telecom customer data using SQLite and then write a Python script to interact with it. 
I have consider a table called customers with columns for customer ID, name, phone number, and plan.

First, need to install the sqlite3 library, which is a built-in library in Python for working with SQLite databases.

The database structure for telecom customer data was designed with the following considerations:

Entity-Relationship Model: The database follows an entity-relationship (ER) model, which is a common approach for organizing data in a relational database. In this model, entities represent real-world objects, and relationships represent the connections between them.
Normalization: The database is normalized to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity. This means that data is stored in a way that minimizes duplication and ensures consistency.
Primary Key: Each customer record is uniquely identified by a primary key, which is an auto-incrementing integer named customer_id. This primary key ensures that each customer can be uniquely referenced and distinguished from other customers.
Data Types: Appropriate data types are used for each column to ensure data accuracy and consistency. For instance, first_name and last_name are stored as VARCHAR(50), allowing for up to 50 characters.
Activation Date: The activation_date column stores the date when a customer's account was activated. This information can be useful for tracking customer tenure, analyzing activation trends, or identifying customers who are eligible for promotions or upgrades.
Plan Type: The plan_type column stores the customer's current telecom plan type. This information can be used for billing purposes, customer segmentation, or analyzing plan preferences.
Atomic Operations: The Python script uses atomic operations, such as INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE, to ensure data integrity and consistency. 
These operations are executed within transactions, ensuring that data changes are either applied completely or not at all, preventing data inconsistencies.

This database structure provides a well-organized and efficient way to store and manage telecom customer data. 
It facilitates easy retrieval, addition, update, and deletion of customer information, enabling efficient customer management and analysis.


Justifications of the DB: 

Table Name: customers
I chose a clear and concise name for the table that reflects the primary entity of interest in the telecom domain: customers.

Columns:
id (INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT): This column serves as the primary key for uniquely identifying each customer. The AUTOINCREMENT attribute ensures that each new record gets a unique identifier automatically.
name (TEXT NOT NULL): Represents the customer's name. I chose the TEXT type to accommodate variable-length strings.
phone_number (TEXT NOT NULL): Stores the customer's phone number. Again, TEXT is chosen to handle varying lengths of phone numbers.
plan (TEXT NOT NULL): Represents the telecom plan associated with the customer. It could be a string like 'Gold' or 'Silver' or 'Platinams'


Why This Structure:

Normalization: The structure follows basic normalization principles. Each piece of information is stored in a separate column, and the id serves as a primary key. This helps avoid data redundancy and ensures efficient data retrieval and updates.
Simplicity: Given the simplicity of the task, a single table is sufficient to store all relevant customer information. If the application were more complex, additional tables might be necessary to represent relationships, but that isn't needed here.
Flexibility: The chosen structure allows for flexibility in terms of adding new customers, updating their information, and deleting records when necessary. The AUTOINCREMENT feature ensures that each customer gets a unique identifier.
Readability: The table and column names are clear and descriptive, enhancing the overall readability and maintainability of the database schema.
Compatibility: The chosen data types (TEXT for strings, INTEGER for the primary key) are suitable for the types of data being stored, ensuring compatibility and efficient storage.
